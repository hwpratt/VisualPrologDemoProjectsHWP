Application name:   TicTackToeN

What:               Play TicTacToe with a board size of your choosing.

Why:                A little demonstration app testing Vip 9x installation, with some hints for new VIP developers.

How to play:        Select game size by clicking a number or 'N' on the toolbar.
                    LEFT CLICK on the board to place your marker.
                    The current player is indicated in the game title.
                    RIGHT CLICK on the game board to display how many ways you can win using a cell.
                    Touch screen play works. Tap once for left click, press and hold for right click.

How to win:         Place your markers in a row, column or diagonal line.
                        The number of contiguous markers to win is:
                            If board size = 3   you need 3 contiguous markers to win.
                            If board size > 3   you need N-1 contiguous markers where N = board size (across or down)
