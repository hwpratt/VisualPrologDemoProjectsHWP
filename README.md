# VisualPrologDemoProjectsHWP
 Tiny demonstration projects in Visual Prolog published as VIP projects.  No executable files are included.

 These are separated into VIP 8x and VIP 9x categories.
 
 I recommend that you download the .ZIP files and expand them to make a new project.
 The .EXE and usual VIP .DLL files are NOT included in the these files.
 
 The 9x projects may not compile unmodified using VIP 8x, but 8x projects should compile using 9x if you follow the IDE prompts.
 
 2020-04-01: Added annotated version of TicTacToeN for VIP 8x.
