How to 'play' the Game of Life

Actually, you cannot 'play' this game in the traditional sense of a game.

What you do is create patterns of cells by clicking on a grid of empty cells
and the computer will create some new cells and delete some other cells
in accordance with the simple rules of the game.

A colored cell is considered to be 'alive', and an uncolored one is 'dead.'
Clicking on a cell it will toggle its state between 'dead' and 'alive.'
